Final Project for CSCI 5502 Data Mining Course

We're looking at data taken from an atmospheric systems model, the Community Earth Systems Model 2 (CESM2), specifically for the Polynesian region in the Pacific Islands. We're examining both historical and predictive data for the region, especially concerning the El Niño and La Niña weather patterns.
